# Notes for matadrs - The automated data reduction pipeline
## To-Do
### Plotter
[ ] Make uv-plot work as well
[ ] Add rotation synthetisis to uv-plot
[ ] Make baseline plot work
[ ] Make waterfall plot work
[ ] Rewrite the multiple fits file approach, and specify somehow which fits-file to use
[ ] Make the waterfall plots work similarly
[ ] Improve plot axes titles
[ ] Make the lband functionality part of the class attributes and not every plot
[ ] Make the plotter take the save name automatically, if none given

## Output
[ ] Make text colored in console, so it is easier readable for example in output-file

## Averaging
[ ] Check that the sorting of the BCDs happens correctly
[ ] Ask Jozsef why he doesnt use the in-out, out-in for N-band

## Calibration
[ ] Add calibration for chopped L-band files

## Reduction
[ ] Add the catalogues and the

## Questions
[ ] Ask Jozsef why in N-band case only two files are used for bcd-calibration!

## Done
[ x ] Make plotter being able to add components to plot and then at the end plot all neatly
[ x ] Make option that excludes the L-band region and excludes the edges -> Nicer visualisation
